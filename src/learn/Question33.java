//A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing
//atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person 
//must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the 
//heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest
//possible number of people in such a tower. 
//EXAMPLE: Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110) 
//Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom: (56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
